*********** CHANGELOG OPTGPSAMPLER VERSION 1.1 *********
30/04/2014
- fixed a bug that could cause samples to go out of the nullspace
- added support for MATLAB mwblas and mwlapack for fast matrix multiplication and SVD
- added SVD in C++ to get the nullspace
- added interrupt handler to use control-c termination in Matlab
- added custom reduceModel
- added sampling summary
- added verbose / non-verbose mode
- added lazy loading of GLPK, GUROBI or CPLEX libraries to allow for easier LP solver plug-in
- added support to use previously collected warmup points
- added a warning for reactions that can not carry flux ("dead reactions")  
- added possibility to only do a warm-up (0 sample points)
- removed the dependency on ACML libraries (instead uses mwblas and mwlapack that ship with MATLAB)
- added robustness test results for 11 publicly available (genome-scale) constraint-based metabolic models
